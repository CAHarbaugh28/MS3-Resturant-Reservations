### Carter's Gourmet Burgers

My app is a resturants website with a reserve feature being the focal point.


## Inspration 
I wanted to make something that I was familiar with, so I decied to make a website for a resturant.

## How to use my app
The homepage has many photos of the menu items in a grid with a reserve button that takes you to the page where you make a reservation. From there you start by looking at the photo diagram of the resturants table layout. You can pick you table with the first dropdown input, the you select the date with a calender date picker. Once those to are you can choose the time of your reservation, click the make reservation button which pops up a modal with text inputs to enter your information. Finally click reserve to lock in your reservation.

## Technologies used
- React
- Node
- Express
- Heroku
- Posgres

## Outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
- If table D1 is selected backend crashes.
- Would like to make an admin page which would show a list of all the reservations in order day by day. With a check in feature that would use a confomation code.
- Still working ot Heroku deployment.
